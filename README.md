# Git subscription to Helm chart

Apply `git-sub` to hub cluster to subscribe to `helloworld-sub` resources, to demo subscribing to Helm chart artifacts through Git.

Inspiration from https://github.com/mikeshng/git-sub-for-helm-sub, `helloworld` helm chart from https://github.com/stolostron/application-lifecycle-samples/tree/main/helloworld-helm.
